## summary

Summary metadata must be completed by Data Custodians onboarding metadata into the Innovation Gateway MVP.
        





### title

Title of the dataset limited to 150 characters. It should provide a short description of the dataset and be unique across the gateway. If your title is not unique, please add a prefix with your organisation name or identifier to differentiate it from other datasets within the Gateway. Please avoid acronyms wherever possible. Good titles should summarise the content of the dataset and if relevant, the region the dataset covers.

### abstract

Provide a clear and brief descriptive signpost for researchers who are searching for data that may be relevant to their research. The abstract should allow the reader to determine the scope of the data collection and accurately summarise its content. The optimal length is one paragraph (limited to 255 characters) and effective abstracts should avoid long sentences and abbreviations where possible

Some datasets may be continuously updated and the number of records will change regularly, so the observation date provides users with the date that the analysis or query was run to generate the particular observation. Multiple observations can be made i.e. an observation of cumulative COVID positive cases by specimen on the 1/1/2021 could be 2M. On the 8/1/2021 a new observation could be 2.1M. Users can add multiple observations.
