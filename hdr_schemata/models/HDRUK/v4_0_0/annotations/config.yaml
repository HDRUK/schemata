  dataCustodian:
    title: "Dataset Custodian"
    description: "This is the organisation responsible for running or supporting the data access request process, as well as enquiries about a dataset. In most this will be the same as the HDR UK Organisation (Hub or Alliance Member). However, in some cases this will be different i.e. Tissue Directory are an HDR UK Gateway organisation but coordinate activities across a number of data publishers i.e. Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank."
  contactPoint:
    guidance: "Organisations are expected to provide a dedicated email address associated with the data access request process. If no contact point is provided in this field, this field will be defaulted to the teams support email provided in the teams setting.\\n**Note:** An employee's email address can only be provided on a temporary basis and if one is provided, **you must obtain explicit consent for this purpose**."
    examples:
      - "gateway@hdruk.ac.uk"
    title: "Contact point"
    description: "Please provide a valid email address that can be used to coordinate data access requests."
  doiName:
    guidance: "- Please note: This is **not** the DOI of the publication(s) associated with the dataset.\\n- All HDR UK registered **datasets** should either have a **(DOI)** or be working towards obtaining one.\\n- If a DOI is available, please provide the DOI.\\n- **What happens if I do not have a DOI?**: Contact your academic organisation to find out if there is an existing relationship with a DOI provider. If that is not available, sites such as figshare offer free services to mint a DOI for your dataset. Subsequent versions of the Metadata Exchange will provide a DOI minting service."
    title: "Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for dataset"
    examples: 
      - 10.1093/ije/dyx196
    description: "DOI associated to this dataset. Find out more about DOIs here: [https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/)"
  populationSize:
    guidance: "This number informs a filter for Researchers to differentiate dataset search results based on the number of people in the dataset, and does not pull from the **Observations** fields. The filter also allows for Researchers to search datasets which have no population size reported, but will **not** pull any population size captured in the **Observations** section."
    title: "Dataset population size"
    description: "Input the number of people captured within the dataset."
    examples: 
      - 1000
  keywords:
    guidance: "- Please provide **relevant** and **specific keywords** that can **improve the search engine optimization** of your dataset.\\n- Please **enter one keyword at a time** and click **Add New Field** to add further keywords.\\n- Text from the title is automatically included in the search, there is no need to include this in the keywords.\\n- Include words that researcher may include in their searches."

We are compiling a standardised list of keywords and synonyms across datasets to make filtering easier for users."
  title:
    guidance: "- The **title** should provide a short description of the dataset and be **unique** across the gateway.\\n- If your title is not unique, please **add a prefix with your organisation name or identifier** to differentiate it from other datasets within the Gateway.\\n- If an accronym is widely used the dataset name, please add it in brackets () at the end of the title.\\n- Good titles should summarise the content of the dataset and if relevant, **the region the dataset covers**.\\n- **Example**: North West London COVID-19 Patient Level Situation Report"
