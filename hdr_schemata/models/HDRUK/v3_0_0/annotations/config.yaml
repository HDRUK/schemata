    description: "This is the organisation responsible for running or supporting the data access request process, as well as enquiries about a dataset. In most this will be the same as the HDR UK Organisation (Hub or Alliance Member). However, in some cases this will be different i.e. Tissue Directory are an HDR UK Gateway organisation but coordinate activities across a number of data publishers i.e. Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank."
  contactPoint:
    guidance: "Organisations are expected to provide a dedicated email address associated with the data access request process. If no contact point is provided in this field, this field will be defaulted to the teams support email provided in the teams setting.\\n**Note:** An employee's email address can only be provided on a temporary basis and if one is provided, **you must obtain explicit consent for this purpose**."

    description: "If known, what is the typical time span that a patient appears in the dataset (follow up period). In a prospective cohort study, after baseline information is collected, participants are followed “longitudinally” i.e. new information is collected about them for a period of time afterward. This is known as the “follow up period”. What is the typical time span of follow up, e.g. 1 year, 5 years? If there are multiple cohorts in the dataset with varying follow up periods, please provide the longest follow up period."
